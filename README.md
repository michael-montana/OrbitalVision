# üõ∞Ô∏è OrbitalVision - Visualizing Earth from Space with Python

Welcome to **OrbitalVision**! This Python-powered project utilizes the **Microsoft Planetary Computer API** to download and visualize satellite imagery of Earth. Explore the beauty of our planet from above, with detailed views of continents, clouds, and city lights.

## üåç What does OrbitalVision do?

OrbitalVision allows you to:
- **Download high-resolution satellite images** from the Microsoft Planetary Computer.
- **Visualize these images** with ease, providing stunning views of Earth from space.
- Process images from popular datasets like **Sentinel-2** and **Landsat** collections.

# üõ†Ô∏è How to get started?

## ü•á Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.5 or higher
- Hint: There is **no** API key needed for the [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/)

## ü•à Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OrbitalVision.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```powershell
pip install pystac_client rasterio
pip install pystac-client planetary-computer odc-stac matplotlib
pip install pystac-client planetary-computer rioxarray matplotlib
```

## ü•â Running the project

```powershell
python template.py
```

# üì∏ Example Output
Below is an example of satellite imagery visualized using OrbitalVision:

```powershell
python template.py
```

# üåê Modifying the Search Query

To customize the images you download, you can modify the following part of the code. Here‚Äôs what each parameter does:

```python
search = stac.search(
    collections=["sentinel-2-l2a"],
    bbox=[139.780726,35.625192,139.806798,35.644672],
    datetime="2022-12-01T10:00:00Z/2024-12-31T14:00:00Z",
    query={"eo:cloud_cover": {"lt": 20}},
    limit=40
)
```

## Parameters you can modify:

1. **`collections`**:  
   The dataset you are querying from. For example:
   - `"sentinel-2-l2a"` for Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery
   - `"landsat-c2-l2"` for Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 imagery

   Change this depending on which dataset you want to pull from.

2. **`bbox` (Bounding Box)**:  
   Defines the geographical area for the search. This is a list in the format `[min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat]`. 
   - Example: `bbox=[139.780726, 35.625192, 139.806798, 35.644672]` specifies an area in Tokyo, Japan.  
   Modify this to query images from different parts of the world.

   With http://bboxfinder.com you will find your coordinates.

3. **`datetime`**:  
   The time range for your search in the format `"start_time/end_time"`.  
   - Example: `"2022-12-01T10:00:00Z/2024-12-31T14:00:00Z"`  
   Adjust the time range to get images from different time periods.

4. **`query`**:  
   You can filter the results based on certain criteria. In this case, we‚Äôre filtering for cloud cover with the `"eo:cloud_cover"` parameter:
   - `"lt": 20` means less than 20% cloud cover.  
   You can adjust this to allow for more or less cloud cover, or add other filters.

5. **`limit`**:  
   Limits the number of results returned.  
   - Example: `limit=40` fetches up to 40 images. You can change this depending on how many images you want to retrieve.

# üöÄ Future Improvements
